# Neural Network From Scratch

## About This Project
This project is a simple neural network built completely from scratch using Python.
No machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or NumPy were used.

The purpose of this project is to understand how neural networks learn internally.

## What This Program Does
The program trains a neural network to solve the XOR problem.
XOR is a basic logic problem that requires learning non-linear patterns.

The network learns by:
- Making a prediction
- Comparing it with the correct answer
- Slowly adjusting its weights
- Repeating this process until the output improves

## How the Learning Works (Simple Explanation)
1. Input values are given to the network
2. The network multiplies inputs with weights
3. An activation function is applied
4. The output is compared with the expected result
5. The error is used to update the weights
6. After many repetitions, the network learns

## How to Run the Project
Make sure Python is installed, then run:

```bash
python neural_network_from_scratch.py
